# Migrate reward/Bonus points from Magento to shopware

Scripts to migrate bonus points from a magento 2.x shop (from mirasvit rewards
plugin) to a
shopware 5 shop (with some plugin?). Pretty specific use case.

## DB

Mirasvit stores the points in transactions, and the sums are not stored in db,
afaics.

## Plan of action

  * Map customer ids to reward points
